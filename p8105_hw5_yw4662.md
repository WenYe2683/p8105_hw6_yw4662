## Problem 1

``` r
# Import homicide data from Washington Post GitHub
homicide_raw <- read_csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv"
)
```

    ## Rows: 52179 Columns: 12
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (9): uid, victim_last, victim_first, victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex...
    ## dbl (3): reported_date, lat, lon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

``` r
# Clean and create city_state + solved indicator
homicide_clean <- homicide_raw %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state),
    solved = disposition == "Closed by arrest"
  )%>%
  filter(
    !city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", 
                      "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL")
  ) %>%
  filter(victim_race %in% c("White", "Black")) %>%
  mutate(
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    victim_sex = factor(victim_sex),
    victim_race = factor(victim_race)
  )
```

### Baltimore Logistic Regression and Adjusted OR (Male VS Female)

``` r
baltimore_df <- homicide_clean %>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

baltimore_fit <- glm(
  solved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race,
  data = baltimore_df,
  family = binomial()
)

baltimore_OR <- baltimore_fit %>%
  tidy(conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE) %>%
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>%
  select(term, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)

baltimore_OR
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 4
    ##   term           estimate conf.low conf.high
    ##   <chr>             <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1 victim_sexMale    0.426    0.324     0.558

### Logistic Regression for Each City and OR (Male VS Female)

``` r
city_ORs <- homicide_clean %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(
    fit = map(
      data,
      ~ glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race,
            data = .x,
            family = binomial())
    ),
    tidied = map(
      fit,
      ~ tidy(.x, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE)
    )
  ) %>%
  unnest(tidied) %>%
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>%
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

    ## Warning: There were 43 warnings in `mutate()`.
    ## The first warning was:
    ## ℹ In argument: `tidied = map(fit, ~tidy(.x, conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate =
    ##   TRUE))`.
    ## ℹ In group 1: `city_state = "Albuquerque, NM"`.
    ## Caused by warning:
    ## ! glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred
    ## ℹ Run `dplyr::last_dplyr_warnings()` to see the 42 remaining warnings.

### Plot of Adjusted ORs by City

``` r
city_ORs %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = estimate, y = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate))) +
  geom_point(color = "#0057A8") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = conf.low, xmax = conf.high), width = 0) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1, linetype = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Adjusted odds ratios for solving homicides (Male vs Female)",
    x = "Adjusted OR (Male vs Female)",
    y = NULL
  )
```

### Comment

1.  **Most cities have adjusted ORs near 1**: An OR of 1 means that
    homicides involving male victims and female victims are equally
    likely to be solved after adjusting for covariates. Most cities fall
    between 0.7 and 1.3, indicating little to no difference in solve
    rates by victim sex.

2.  **Cities with very wide confidence intervals**: Some cities have
    long error bars, indicating smaller sample sizes, high uncertainty
    in estimates, and limited ability to draw conclusions.
